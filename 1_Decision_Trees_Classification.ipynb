    "This notebook will show you how you can train a `DecisionTreeClassifier` with sklearn. \n",
    "The structure of the code matches that of a Python script. First, all used functions are listed and called in the function \"main\" at the end of the script. The results are then displayed at the very end by `if __name__ == \"__main__\":`. A more detailed explanation of the function `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` can be found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/419163/what-does-if-name-main-do).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Task:**\n",
    "The functions are missing docstrings and it's your task to change it! Try to understand what each function is doing and give it a proper docstring. \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Docstrings:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, docstrings serve as inline documentation for functions, classes, modules, and packages (describing what a piece of code does, its parameters, return values, any exceptions, etc.) without having to read the code itself. \n",
    "This might be especially useful later when you work with large codebases or when reviewing unfamiliar code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python's built-in `help()` function and various IDEs and development tools can use docstrings to provide contextual help and code introspection. This allows developers to quickly access information about function signatures, parameters, and usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using docstrings is good practice for promoting code readability, facilitating collaboration among developers (including your future self), and enabling tools for code introspection and automated documentation generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### \"autoDocstring\" VSCode extension:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the beginning of the bootcamp during setting up your machines, the \"autoDocstring\" extension for VSCode was installed (if not you can search for it and install it now). The extension can facilitate and standardize writing docstrings for your code: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Checking docstrings:** In VS Code, you can use the built-in code suggestions feature to view docstrings of functions, methods, and classes. Simply place the cursor on the function or class name, press `Ctrl + Space`, and you'll see a tooltip with the docstring information if it's available.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Writing docstrings with autoDocstring extension:** The \"autoDocstring\" extension for VS Code helps you generate docstrings quickly and efficiently by typing `\"\"\"` or `'''` (triple quotes) and pressing Enter. It will generate a template docstring with placeholders for parameters, return values, and other relevant information. You can then fill in the details accordingly. Pressing `tab` will guide you to the next part of the docstring where your individual input is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing docstrings, it's good practice to follow the Python docstring conventions outlined in [PEP 257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/). This includes using triple quotes (`\"\"\"`) for multi-line docstrings, using the appropriate sections (e.g., Parameters, Returns, Raises) to describe function behaviour, and adhering to a consistent style within your codebase.\n",
